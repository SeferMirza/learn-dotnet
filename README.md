## Researches

There are some that we have researched to use here, but as a result of the
research, we have decided not to use them or to use them later.

You can see them in the links below.

### .NET

- **[Publish Over Dockerfile:](/publish-over-dockerfile/README.md)** We've
  considered using `dotnet publish` over `Dockerfile`. For now we've decided to
  keep using `Dockerfile`.

### ASP.NET Core

- **[Model Binders:](./model-binders/README.md)** How to map custom types to
  action parameters to allow entities directly from action parameters
- **[Native AOT:](./native-aot/README.md)** We are considering using
  `Native AOT` for our small and minimal API and CLI applications. For now, we
  are not using Native AOT because it is new and does not satisfy many of our
  needs.
