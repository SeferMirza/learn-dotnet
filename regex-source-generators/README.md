# Regex Source Generators

We often use `Regex` to simplify string expressions or to extract parts of
them. For example, taking only the namespace part from the fullname of a class
or taking only the domain name from the url.

## `GeneratedRegex` Attribute

With this method, we can take the same regex operations in different methods
to a single place and manage them from there.

See [Learn Regex](./RegexSourceGenerators/LearnRegex.cs) for an example.
