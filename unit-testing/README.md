# Unit Testing

This tutorial is about `Fluent Assertion` and `Shouldly` libraries. The aim is
to learn both libraries and choose the one to be used in our projects.

## Test Case

In the test, we aim for story consistency and legibility while avoiding
unnecessary information. We strictly adhere to standards, such as the
[3A Pattern](/README.md#3a-pattern).

### 3A Pattern

## Test Case Naming

## Shouldly Library

## Mock Library

## GiveMe & MockMe Usage
